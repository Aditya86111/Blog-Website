        <p>CSS was first created around 1996 to make sense of HTML and make the webpage look and feel amazing.
           Just as with any language, you have to write CSS, and knowing how we write CSS is a skill that any
            webpage developer needs to have. Easy to maintain, CSS is the second part of the two-part tool kit
             for webpage creation.Web accessibility is really important to many employers and companies nowadays,
              and there is fierce competition in creating the most accessible and well-designed webpage. Learning
               some software development fundamentals involving CSS can help you learn how to create accessible web pages.
          If HTML is the bones of the body, then CSS is the skin that covers it. It’s used for background colour, styling,
           layout, borders, shadowing – all the essential design bits and bobs that make a webpage look slick and smart. CSS
            enables you to distinguish between presentation and content by modifying the design and display of HTML elements.
           Presentation and ease of use are a couple of the main things that CSS has bought to web design by translating the 
           way content looks on a webpage and what else goes on it to complement that content. While frequently used in
            conjunction with HTML, it is actually independent of it, and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
        </p>
        <h2>Section 1.1</h2>
        <p>
          Many people believe that HTML and CSS are the same, but they’re actually both quite distinct languages.
           While they are often used together in coding and Web design, they can both be used separately too, and
            both have a myriad of different applications. Let’s take a look at some of the key differences between 
            HTML and CSS. HTML defines the content and the structure of a webpage, whereas CSS translates the display
             and the design of the HTML elements
          As a result, an HTML can incorporate CSS code in its files, but CSS cannot contain HTML in its sheets
          HTML is one set ‘type’ or ‘method’, whereas, depending on requirement, CSS can either be internal or external
          HTML isn’t used for presentation or visualisation, whereas CSS is
          When it comes to writing the language, HTML has quite a clear and easy-to-understand syntax, whereas
           CSS can get a little bit more complicated and confusing
          HTML uses ‘tags’ on either side of the content, whereas CSS uses ‘selectors’ that are followed by a declaration block
          The code used by HTML is much larger than the one used by CSS, giving CSS a lesser webpage loading time
          The primary function of HTML is to create web pages, whereas CSS is used to control the layout and the style 
          of these webpages
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1.2</h3>
        <p>
          In the world of web development, you’ll come across a whole ream of different languages used for programming
           – like Java, Ruby, Python, SQL, and Perl. These five programming languages are actually in the bracket of what’s
            known as back-end development programming languages. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are in the bracket of front-end development.
            With so many different programming languages to choose from, you’ll find it tricky when it comes to choosing 
            a programming language. However, an initial understanding of what the different programming languages are used
             for will be beneficial in deciding which one you choose to learn.  
          You’ll likely see many people decrying the fact that HTML and CSS are lumped in with other coding languages and tell
           you that they aren’t actually proper coding languages themselves. And while they might not be quite as flexible as
            other coding languages, especially in terms of their practical possibilities, they’re both highly specialised languages
             that can do really interesting things. 
          The main reason why HTML and CSS aren’t considered programming languages is because they only determine the structure and 
          the style of the webpage you’re building. They don’t contain any instructions like the other front-end languages.
